			Greetings from the WCCI 2026 Special Session Organisers,<br /><br />
			<b>IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI)</b> 2026
			is the world's largest technical event on computational
			intelligence, featuring the three flagship conferences of the IEEE
			Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) under one roof. WCCI 2024
			will be held in Maastricht, The Netherlands. It will take place in
			the beautiful and historic city of Maastricht, a vibrant hub of
			culture, innovation, and international collaboration.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are inviting you to join us for our Special Session on 'AI, Law
			and Regulation', aims to provide the WCCI 2026 community with an
			interdisciplinary platform to explore how AI model architectures,
			data inputs, and system outputs interact with emerging global
			regulatory frameworks.
		</p>
		<p>
			This special session seeks to
			<u>
				connect critical legal perspectives on the governance frameworks
				for AI
			</u>
			: promoting responsible innovation with regulatory compliance
			demands that developers, policymakers, and legal scholars engage
			collaboratively to anticipate governance needs across the AI value
			chain, from model conception and data governance to decision
			outputs, decommissioning and accountability mechanisms.
		</p>
		<p>
			This session will focus on bridging the gap between system
			architecture and legal governance, addressing how technical
			configurations can both reflect and challenge existing regulatory
			norms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Main topics of this special session include the regulatory landscape
			and issues associated with the model architecture, inputs and
			outputs. The call is also particularly interested in submissions
			looking at the implementation of Responsible AI safeguards for
			systems operating in high-impact contexts, in-the-world.
		</p>
