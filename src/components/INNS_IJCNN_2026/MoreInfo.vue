			More Details About the Special Session
		</h3>
		<p>
			This Special Session aims to provide the WCCI 2026 community with an
			interdisciplinary platform to explore how AI model architectures,
			data inputs, and system outputs interact with emerging global
			regulatory frameworks. As landmark instruments such as the EU AI
			Act, GDPR, OECD AI Principles, Council of Europe Convention on
			Artificial Intelligence, regional frameworks across US,
			Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America reshape the global AI
			landscape, understanding their implications for technical design and
			deployment has become essential.
		</p>
		<p>
			AI systems are now deeply embedded in critical domains (healthcare,
			finance, defence, education, and creative industries) introducing
			new legal, ethical, and societal challenges. Promoting responsible
			innovation with regulatory compliance demands that developers,
			policymakers, and legal scholars engage collaboratively to
			anticipate governance needs across the AI value chain, from model
			conception and data governance to decision outputs, decommissioning
			and accountability mechanisms.
		</p>
		<p>
			This session will focus on bridging the gap between system
			architecture and legal governance, addressing how technical
			configurations can both reflect and challenge existing regulatory
			norms. It seeks contributions that illuminate how regulation can be
			effectively translated into system design principles, compliance
			processes, and auditability tools that uphold transparency,
			fairness, and human rights. The call is also particularly interested
			in submissions looking at the implementation of Responsible AI
			safeguards for systems operating in high-impact contexts,
			in-the-world.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Topics of Interest:</b>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Governance by Architecture</b>: Embedding legal and ethical
				norms into model design and training processes, approaches to
				responsible data acquisition.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Data Provenance and Input Accountability</b>: Legal standards
				for data sourcing, consent, labelling and watermarking, and
				ownership, privacy engineering, implementation frameworks for
				human-oversight and red teaming.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Explainability and Output Reliability</b>: evidentiary
				standards, and transparency requirements, best practices for
				explainability in AI decision-making.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Dynamic and Adaptive Models</b>: Regulating continuously
				learning systems and post-deployment legal drift, as well as
				generative, agentic and multi-modal systems.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Auditability and Traceability</b>: Technical tools for legal
				compliance, model monitoring, and accountability, and critical
				safeguards operationalising legal and ethical principles.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Global Regulatory Convergence</b>Global Regulatory
				Convergence: Comparative analysis of the EU AI Act, GDPR, OECD,
				U.S., and non-Western AI governance frameworks, and their impact
				on system's design.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Constitutional and Alignment Governance</b>: The role of
				normative “AI constitutions”, by design policies and metrics in
				shaping behaviour and legal responsibility.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Human Rights, Democracy, and AI Sovereignty</b>: Innovation
				for Social Progress considering global justice, equity, and
				digital sovereignty, rights to remedy and restitution with new
				frontiers in AI.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			By connecting technical system design with regulatory
			implementation, this session will contribute to the development of
			globally coherent, trustworthy, and human-centered AI governance
			frameworks.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Format</b>
			: 5-6 paper presentations + 30-45 minute roundtable discussion
			format with presenters.
