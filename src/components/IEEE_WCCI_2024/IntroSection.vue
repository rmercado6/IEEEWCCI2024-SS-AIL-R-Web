      <p>Greetings from the WCCI 2024 Special Session Organisers,</p>
      <p>
        <b>IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI) 2024</b> is the world’s largest technical event on computational intelligence, 
        featuring the three flagship conferences of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) under one roof. <b>WCCI 2024 will be held in Yokohama, Japan.</b> 
        Yokohama is a city that inspires academic fusion and multidisciplinary & industrial association. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We are inviting you to <b>join us</b> for our <b>Special Session on ‘AI, Law and Regulation’</b>, designed to serve the WCCI community with an inevitable, 
        collaborative discussion on the <u>governance and implementation of global regulatory standards (AI Act, GDPR and beyond) to incentivise responsible innovation</u> 
        and prevent technical debt, as demanded and shaped by the law. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This special session seeks to <u>connect critical legal perspectives on the governance frameworks for AI</u>: regulatory considerations, industry standards, 
        best practices, and how AI undermines current legal assumptions and how these will be addressed. The session seeks contributions which will reduce gaps between 
        system architecture design, input and output and their legal ramifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Main topics of this special session include the <b>regulatory landscape</b> and issues associated with the model architecture, inputs and outputs.
      </p>
      <ol class="space-y-3">
        <li>
          <b>System Input</b>: aspects of Intellectual Property (Copyright Protection etc.), Data Protection and Privacy, and Transparency requirements
          for Generative and Predictive models etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Model Architecture</b>: aspects of eXplainability, transparency, interpretability of decision-making processes, model safety (cyber security) 
          and accountability (liability, negligence etc.), practices and obligations
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>System Output</b>: aspects of regulating the disruption arising from AI applications, impact on various industries including finance, healthcare,
          education, media, advertisement etc.
        </li>
