        More Details About the Special Session
      </h3>
      <p>
        Breakthrough discoveries in Artificial Intelligence applications began to permeate the lives of ordinary people, 
        challenging the economy, education, and creative industries.  While seeking to support innovative solutions and facilitate investment, 
        influential global powerhouses began adopting regulations to safeguard the interests, and fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens. 
        Hence, the regulatory challenges, issues, and landscape across the AI value chain of design, development, and deployment are at the forefront 
        of legal debate. It is critical to highlight the foreseeable legislative changes and impact on AI pioneers by bridging the interdisciplinary 
        gap between AI developers and socio-legal aspects of AI Applications. Chiefly, whether we are looking at discriminative or generative models 
        â€“ it is necessary to present a comparative view of the existing rules, issues, and compliance obligations against the technical possibilities 
        and limitations of system architectures. This special session seeks to connect critical legal perspectives on the governance frameworks for AI: 
        regulatory considerations, industry standards, best practices, and how AI undermines current legal assumptions and how these will be addressed. 
        The session seeks contributions that will reduce gaps between system architecture design, input and output, and their legal ramifications.

      <p>
        This session is designed to serve the WCCI community with an inevitable discussion on the governance and implementation of global regulatory 
        standards (AI Act, GDPR and beyond) to incentivise responsible innovation and prevent technical debt, as demanded and shaped by the law. Main 
        topics of this special session include the regulatory landscape and issues associated with the model architecture, inputs and outputs.
