            News: AI Policy Workshop @IJCNN 2025
        </h3>
        <p>
            This year, apart from our Special Session on ‘AI, Law and Regulation’, we are pleased to announce that we
            will be hosting a workshop on AI Policy: Today and Tomorrow intended to support our technical IJCNN
            community to navigate the imminent AI regulatory landscape. We will have an opportunity to hear from leading
            figures in the European as well as International AI Policy field, particularly in relation to the
            enforcement of the AI Act.<br/>
            More details on the speakers and the date will be announced soon.
