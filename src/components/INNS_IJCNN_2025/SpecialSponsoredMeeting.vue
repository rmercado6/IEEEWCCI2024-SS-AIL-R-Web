            News: AI Policy and Regulation Workshop @IJCNN 2025
        </h3>
        <p>
            This year, apart from our Special Session on ‘AI, Law and Regulation’, we are pleased to announce that we
            will be hosting a workshop on AI Policy and Regulation intended to support our technical IJCNN
            community to navigate the imminent AI regulatory landscape. We will have an opportunity to hear from leading
            figures in the European as well as International AI Policy field, particularly in relation to the
            enforcement of the AI Act.<br/>
            <br/>
            Workshop-only, or full conference registration is available

        <p>
            This AI Policy and Regulation workshop responds to the imminent global AI policy and regulatory changes with
            profound implications for AI and Neural Networks research and industry deployment. By welcoming diverse
            perspectives from policy and lawmakers, industry, and academia, the workshop unveils how emerging frameworks
            such as the European AI Act will shape the neural networks research community's technical innovation,
            deployment, and priorities. This collaborative discussion will assist the community in navigating the complex
            regulatory landscape, provide insights for AI system pioneers, and facilitate alignment with emerging
            certification and standardization mechanisms and fundamental frameworks on human rights and AI.
