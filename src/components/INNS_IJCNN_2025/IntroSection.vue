            Greetings from the IJCNN 2025 Special Session Organisers,<br/><br/>
            The International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) is the premier international conference in the
            area of neural networks theory, analysis and applications. IJCNN 2025 held in Rome, Italy promises to be an
            unforgettable experience that will inspire and propel the AI and neural network community forward.
            We are excited to invite you to contribute to our <b>CALL FOR PAPERS</b> for our <b>Special Session on ‘AI,
            Law and Regulation’</b>, designed to serve the IJCNN community with an inevitable, collaborative discussion
            on the
            <u>governance and implementation of influential regulatory standard – such as the AI Act, GDPR and other
                emerging instruments worldwide – to encourage responsible innovation</u> while addressing potential
            technical, legal, and ethical challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            This special session seeks to <u>connect critical legal perspectives on the governance frameworks for AI</u>:
            regulatory considerations, industry standards, best practices, and how AI undermines current legal
            assumptions and how these will be addressed. The session seeks contributions which will reduce gaps between
            system architecture design, input and output and their legal ramifications, particularly in 5 focus areas
            <b>(1) Healthcare and Finance (2) Creative Industries (3) Military Applications (4) Employment and Benefits,
                and (5) Education</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Main topics of this special session include the <b>regulatory and ethical</b> landscape and issues associated with
            the model architecture, inputs and outputs.
