            </li>
            <li>
                Must be submitted by the January 15, 2025 deadline.

        </ul>
        <h4>Submission Guidelines:</h4>
        <p>
            Contributions related to the Special Session must be submitted through the CMT paper submission website as a
            regular paper (Main Track) by selecting this special session “AI, Law and Regulation” as primary Subject
            Area. All submitted papers will be reviewed in the same process as the regular papers. Accepted
            contributions will be part of the conference proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the special sessions serve an important and different role than the regular track papers, they will be
            handled slightly differently. In addition to quality of papers, the relevance and timeliness of the topics
            will be given some weight.

            More Details About the Special Session
        </h3>
        <p>
            Breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly permeating everyday life, reshaping sectors
            such as the economy, medicine, military, education, and creative industries. As global powerhouses strive to
            foster innovation and attract investment, they are also enacting regulations to safeguard the interests,
            rights, and freedoms of their citizens. Consequently, the ethical and regulatory challenges across the AI
            value chain—spanning design, development, and deployment—are now at the forefront of legal and policy
            debates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bridging the interdisciplinary gap between AI developers and the socio-legal dimensions of AI is critical to
            understanding the foreseeable legislative changes and their impact on AI pioneers. Whether considering
            discriminative or generative models, it is essential to compare existing rules, challenges, and compliance
            requirements with the technical capabilities and limitations of system architectures.
        </p>
        <p>
            This special session aims to connect key legal and ethical perspectives on governance frameworks for AI,
            addressing regulatory considerations, AI standards, and best practices. Particular attention is given to EU
            regulations, such as the AI Act and GDPR etc., which serve as significant points of reference for
            responsible innovation and regulatory compliance across industries, inspiring similar frameworks in other
            regions. However, this session strongly encourages contributions exploring non-EU Laws and Regulations that
            influence AI’s systems design and implementation. We seek contributions that reduce the gaps between system
            architecture design, model inputs and outputs, and their legal implications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Designed to engage the IJCNN community, this session will dive into the critical governance and
            implementation of regulatory standards and ethical challenges, ethical and regulatory challenges surrounding
            model architectures, inputs, and outputs. Our priority application areas this year include, but are not
            limited to:
